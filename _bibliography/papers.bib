	abstract = {Any theory of language acquisition logically calls for a theory of the development and the epistemological foundations of individual grammars, yet the exact manner with which grammars emerge has been perennially debated (see Bavin 2009 for a review). Against this background, this work advocates for the potential of a Dynamical Systems take on grammar construction and generative grammar. I assume here Chomsky’s (2005) Three Factors approach, as well as neo-emergentist approaches to language variation, which put forward a radically impoverished Universal Grammar (Biberauer’s 2011, et seq., Maximise Minimal Means model; cf. also Ramchand & Svenonius 2014, Wiltschko 2014, Wiltschko 2021). Taking as a point of departure a maximally poor set of starting conditions (Universal Grammar) and the assumption that there exists a third-factor principle that aims to maximise minimal means, I then show how Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) naturally complements these perspectives on learnability and offer one possible theoretical implementation of DST in this context. The suggested architecture attempts to relate acquisition, cognition and representation explicitly: symbolic dynamics and contextual emergence analyses of DST allow us to interrelate, both metaphorically and topologically, (i) acquisitional dynamics, (ii) conceptual spaces (à la Gärdenfors 2000, 2014) and (iii) the representational system being derived from these interactions. The acquisitional and theoretical consequences of the proposal are also discussed.},

  	abstract ={This paper analyses the emergence of illocutionary complementisers (in the sense of Corr 2016) through a corpus study with Catalan and Spanish children. The production of illocutionary complementisers by ten Catalan- and Spanish-speaking children in the CHILDES database is quantified and compared to the production of finite embedding complementisers. The results indicate that illocutionary complementisers emerge early in the child production data, often well before embedding complementisers first appear. These preliminary findings, which illustrate important developmental differences between kinds of complementisers, are hard to account for in approaches that take functional categories to mature bottom-up, with left-peripheral knowledge developing last. I argue, instead, that the early emergence of illocutionary complementisers favours a view which takes the C-domain to be present early on in child grammars.},

I finish by considering the development of Italo-Romance complementisers as a future direction, suggesting that a deeper analysis of child ‘errors’ or input-divergent utterances may provide significant insights into the theoretical questions presented, as much as grammatical ones.},
