I'll be at [GLOW 47](https://glowlinguistics.org/47/) giving two presentations: a talk, 'Expressive negation with proper nouns? Syntactic variation in the distribution of Rita in Catalan', at Workshop II: Negation, and a poster (with Theresa Biberauer), 'V2 all the way down: Germanic innovations in the embedded CP of German-Italian bilinguals'.
