  <summary class="project-title">Acquisition of Expletive Subjects</summary>
  <p><i>With Theresa Biberauer</i></p> 
  <p>This work looks at the development of expletive types (esp. weather vs. existential) in German, English and Dutch children. We show that children selectively drop expletive subjects, with omission targeting weather (but not existential) expletives. We offer a novel perspective on subject drop, by integrating the notion of categorial differentiation to derive the order of acquisition of subject distinctions. </p>

  <summary class="project-title">Acquisition of Negative Concord in Catalan and Spanish</summary>
  <p><i>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.neglab.de/projects/c06/">NegLaB project C06</a> (PIs Esther Rinke and Petra Schulz)</i></p> 
  <p>As part of a short-term research fellowship with NegLaB, I worked on the first study of the acquisition of Negative Concord in Catalan and Spanish, which I then compared to the development of West Germanic Negative Quantifiers. I propose that the Catalan and Spanish data provides novel evidence against Negative Concord is acquisitionally more ‘default’ than a Double Negation system.   </p>
