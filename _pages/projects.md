  <summary class="project-title">Acquisition of Expletive Subjects</summary>
  <p><i>With Theresa Biberauer</i>.</p> 
  <p>This work looks at the development of expletive types (esp. weather vs. existential) in German, English and Dutch children. We show that children selectively drop expletive subjects, with omission targeting weather (but not existential) expletives. We offer a novel perspective on subject drop, by integrating the notion of categorial differentiation to derive the order of acquisition of subject distinctions. </p>
