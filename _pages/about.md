Hello! I'm N√∫ria Bosch [Àànu…æi…ô Œ≤…îsk], a **third-year PhD student** in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge (St John's College). I specialise in syntax and first language acquisition.

I'm supervised by [Bert Vaux](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/bv230) and [Theresa Biberauer](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/dr-theresa-biberauer) and I'm supported by an OOC AHRC DTP - St John's studentship. I'm also an Honorary Cambridge Trust Scholar. My PhD project is outlined on the [AHRC website](https://www.oocdtp.ac.uk/people/nuria-bosch). 

During Fall 2025, I am a visiting student at the Department of Linguistics at [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics.html), sponsored by [Ail√≠s Cournane](https://wp.nyu.edu/cournane/) and [Gary Thoms](https://sites.google.com/site/garythoms/). 

From April-July 2025, I was a short-term Doctoral Fellow at the DFG-funded [NegLaB Collaborative Research Centre](https://www.neglab.de) (Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt), where I worked with [Esther Rinke](https://www.neglab.de/prof-dr-esther-rinke/) and [Petra Schulz](https://www.neglab.de/prof-dr-petra-schulz/).

Before my PhD, I completed a BA and MPhil in Linguistics also at the University of Cambridge (St John's College), supervised by Theresa Biberauer. You can find my **full CV [here](https://nuria-bosch.github.io/assets/pdf/Bosch_cv_August_2025.pdf)**.

I'm interested in **syntax** (theoretical, comparative, diachronic), **language acquisition** and **biolinguistics**. In my work, I probe a so-called **neo-emergentist** approach to language acquisition and variation, which assumes a maximally impoverished Universal Grammar. I have a keen interest in interdisciplinary approaches to language.

Some of the projects I've worked on and/or I'm interested in include:

- Acquisition of functional categories (including cartographic categories) from a neo-emergentist perspective.
- Structure, variation and acquisition of the left periphery.
- Foundations of functional/extended projections (theoretically and developmentally).
- Acquisition of negation and Negative Concord crosslinguistically. 
- Acquisition of illocutionary complementisers in Ibero-Romance and Italian.
- Relationship betweeen L1 (and L2) acquirers, developmental patterns and language change.
- Applications of dynamical systems theory and category theory in linguistics.
- Expressive language in Catalan and Spanish, and crosslinguistically.
    
When not doing linguistics, I can be found reading, listening to music, coding, travelling and following Barcelona's football games (or, more rarely, playing football). I'm originally from Ripoll, a small town in the north of Catalonia, next to the Pyrenees and near the French border.
