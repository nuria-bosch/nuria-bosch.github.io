I'm Núria Bosch [ˈnuɾiə βɔsk], an incoming PhD student at the University of Cambridge (St John's College). I specialise in syntax and language acquisition.

I'm supervised by Bert Vaux and Theresa Biberauer and I am supported by an OOC AHRC DTP - St John's studentship. I am also an Honorary Cambridge Trust Scholar.

Before my PhD, I completed a BA and MPhil in Linguistics also at the University of Cambridge (St John's College), supervised by Theresa Biberauer.
