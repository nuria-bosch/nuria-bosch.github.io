Hello! I'm N√∫ria Bosch [Àànu…æi…ô Œ≤…îsk], an **incoming PhD student** in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge (St John's College). I specialise in syntax and language acquisition.

I'm supervised by [Bert Vaux](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/bv230) and [Theresa Biberauer](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/dr-theresa-biberauer) and I am supported by an OOC AHRC DTP - St John's studentship. I'm also an Honorary Cambridge Trust Scholar.

Before my PhD, I completed a BA and MPhil in Linguistics also at the University of Cambridge (St John's College), supervised by Theresa Biberauer. You can find my full CV [here](https://nuria-bosch.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_July_2023.pdf).

I'm interested in **syntax** (theoretical, comparative, diachronic), **language acquisition** and **biolinguistics**. In my work, I probe a so-called **neo-emergentist** approach to language acquisition and syntax, which assumes a radically impoverished Universal Grammar.

Some of the projects I've worked on and/or I'm interested in include:

- Acquisition of functional categories (including cartographic categories) from a neo-emergentist perspective.
- Acquisition of illocutionary complementisers in Ibero-Romance and Italian.
- Foundations of functional/extended projections (theoretically and developmentally).
- Expressive/evaluative reduplication in Catalan and Spanish syntax.
- Relationship betweeen L1 (and L2) acquirers, developmental patterns and language change. 

When not doing linguistics, I can be found reading, listening to music, coding or doing graphic design, travelling and following Barcelona's football games (or, more rarely, playing football). I'm originally from Ripoll, a small town in the north of Catalonia, next to the Pyrenees and near the French border.
