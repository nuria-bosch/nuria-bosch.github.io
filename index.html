<p>I’m Núria Bosch [ˈnuɾiə βɔsk], an <strong>incoming PhD student</strong> at the University of Cambridge (St John’s College). I specialise in syntax and language acquisition.</p>

<p>I’m supervised by Bert Vaux and Theresa Biberauer and I am supported by an OOC AHRC DTP - St John’s studentship. I am also an Honorary Cambridge Trust Scholar.</p>

<p>Before my PhD, I completed a BA and MPhil in Linguistics also at the University of Cambridge (St John’s College), supervised by Theresa Biberauer.</p>

<p>I’m interested in <strong>syntax</strong> (theoretical, comparative, diachronic), <strong>language acquisition</strong> and <strong>biolinguistics</strong>. In my work, I adopt a so-called <strong>neo-emergentist</strong> approach to language acquisition and syntax, which assumes a radically impoverished Universal Grammar.</p>

<p>Some of the projects I’ve worked on and/or I’m interested in include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acquisition of functional categories (including cartographic categories) from a neo-emergentist perspective).</li>
  <li>Acquisition of illocutionary complementisers in Ibero-Romance and Italian.</li>
  <li>Foundations of functional/extended projections (theoretically and developmentally).</li>
  <li>Null subjects in Dinka (Nilotic).</li>
</ul>

<p>When not doing linguistics, I can be found reading, listening to music, coding or doing graphic design, travelling and following Barcelona’s football games (or, more rarely, playing football). I’m originally from Ripoll, a small town in the north of Catalonia, next to the Pyrenees and near the French border.</p>
